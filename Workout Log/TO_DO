 Accessing data folder:
     Connect your device. Make sure that device has ROOT access.
    Open command prompt (For windows).
    Set path for android platform tools ie set path=”C:\Program Files\Android\android-sdk\platform-tools” and type enter.
    Type adb devices and make sure that the phone is listed after executing the command.
    Type adb shell.
    Type su.
    Type chmod  777  /data  /data/data  /data/data/<packagename>/*
    For example chmod  777  /data  /data/data  /data/data/com.sample.app/*
    Now goto DDMS and check whether the data folder is accessible.


-when deleting history items, if the most recent history item is deleted, going back to the 'create'
screen still shows it.  So, if deleting the most recent item, reload the whole page

-sanitize inputs!
-clean up history screen
-polish the 'about' section
-GET RID OF LEADBOLT
-Fix the freezing on startup issue!
-make background a solid color?  This seems especially necessary for the history screen.
I think it would look good elsewhere as well
-After saving item, the progress bar disappears too quickly and sometimes there is a delay when the
page refreshes

low priority:
-maybe add progress bar to creation of items
-sometimes, when loading slowly, the 'no _____ were found' is visible before the page loads (this may be fixed due to display:none;)
-make tabs on bottom smaller
-put 'use create tab' on first load (done, but the message sometimes appears before css renders)
-fix icon (done - do I need an icon for xhdpi?)
-add weight/reps column header to last screen
-test other android versions (I have tested my phone and emulator on 2.2 API 8)
-update marketing
-cleanup code!
-optimize app!
