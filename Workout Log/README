Workout Log Basic

This is an android app that provides the user with a way to record workout/exercise information.
The user can create profiles, routines, sections (days of week, chest day, leg day, etc.) and exercises.
Workout Log Basic utilizes the ORMLite library to persist data in a SQLite database.  The interface
is written in HTML and Javascript (jQuery) and is displayed in a WebView.  The native java code
communicates with the WebView via a Javascript interface and sends/receives JSON.  The app used to
display banner ads via Leadbolt and various other ads using Airpush, but most of that code has been
commented out for now.  

The app is in a fully functional state.  There are a number of enhancements that I would like to make
(check out the TO_DO file), and LOTS of code cleanup to do.
